# Higher Lower Game Project

This web application, built using Flask, allows users to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 9. 
The application provides real-time feedback on the user's guesses.

## Key Features

**Random Number Generation:**
  - The application generates a random number between 0 and 9 at the start of the game, which the user must guess.

**Flask Web Framework:**
  - The application is built using Flask, allowing for easy routing and handling of user requests.

**Home Route:**
  - The home route displays a message prompting the user to guess a number, along with an embedded GIF for visual engagement.

**Guessing Logic:**
  - The application includes a route that processes the user's guess. It provides feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
